# Questions for C Grade

**Find an elevator, take photos of the interface, and show a gif image of the interface in operation.**

My chosen elevator is located in the file *ElevatorinAction.gif* or you can follow [this link](https://github.com/apape97/HCI-Homework1/blob/master/ElevatorinAction.gif). 

**Find issues with the current design:**

1. There are a lot of keys that can be turned to make the elevator inoperable. 
2. Stop cannot be initiated by the inhabitant in the event of an emergency. 
3. There are a lot of buttons that since this is a residential elevator are unused by many patrons. 
4. To people who live with a different style of elevators (where the ground floor is marked) this elevator is confusing. 

**Why is it bad?**

1. Because of the floor markings it can be very confusing for people who want to return to the ground floor or get to their floor. 
2. The only thing you can do in the event of an emergency is push the Phone Help button which may not be useful if you need action within the next few minutes. 
3. Possibility for a intelligent actor to make the elevator inoperable for the mass public which could cause mass havoc. 

# Questions for B Grade

**List common uses of an elevator:**

1. Go to the floor of your residence. 
2. Go to the ground floor. 

**List more rare uses of an elevator:**

1. Close the doors to initiate travel. 
2. Open the doors to allow more passengers to board. 
3. Call for help in the event of an emergency. 
4. Turn off the elevator's ability to travel to specific floors in the case of floor closings. 
5. Sound the alarm. 
6. Go to a floor other than your floor or the ground floor. 

**Does the interface make doing the common uses of an elevator easier?**

1. Going to your floor can be confusing if you forget your floor number or if you are used to a system that starts at ground, then goes to 1, and so on. 
2. This is even more confusing as the ground floor is not explicitly marked as "ground". 

**What is the common sequence of actions?**

1. Enter elevator from outside. 
2. Press the floor you wish to go to, assuming that the elevator makes it easy to decide which floor is the correct one. 
3. Either wait for elevator to automatically close the doors and travel to your floor *or* press the close door button to attempt making the elevator travel to your floor faster. 

**How does the elevator support the user to figure out how to make it work?**

The elevator supports the user by allowing them to close doors to initiate travel, and labels the buttons in a way that in a left to right, top to bottom reading style leads the user to believe that the button to the right of 4 or 3 or 2 or 1 will take you to that floor. 

**How does the elevator provide feedback to the user?**

The elevator provides feedback solely by lighting up the LED in the middle of the button. 

**What are some common mistakes you can make with this current design?**

1. If you accidentally click the wrong floor you cannot make changes or stop it from going to that floor. 
2. You may enter the elevator and not know how to get to the ground floor. 

**Suggest the improvements to make on the control interface. Sketch your solution. Justify your design decisions.**

The idea for my elevator is to place it in a building where each guest has their own floor and there is no reason for them to travel to a different floor, as that belongs to someone else. Therefore, a simple solution would be to have the guests hold their keycard/phone with NFC Chip embedded, which will be used to verify the guest and send the elevator to their floor. 

My sketch for the home screen can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apape97/HCI-Homework1/master/HomeScreen.png). 

My sketch for the traveling screen that shows after a user has been verified can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apape97/HCI-Homework1/master/TravelingScreen.png). 

This idea works well for the environment that my imaginary elevator is located in: a place where there's nowhere else to go except the specific location and allows for directions to be displayed on screen for the guest. 

# Questions for A Grade

**Come with your design for the touch screen? What is the screen size that you want?**

I would like a large touch screen, preferable around 8.5 by 11 inches. *(The same size as a sheet of notebook paper)*
